# Corsola Android Example

This is an example based on [agdk-egui example](https://github.com/rust-mobile/rust-android-examples), using `corsola` with `winit` and `wgpu`. Note that this cannot be run from the `examples` folder because `cargo android apk build` expects the `target` folder to be within the project directory.
